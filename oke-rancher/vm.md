This will be the first step in our lab.
Our task is to create a virtual machine, 
with everything we need in order to create a Kubernetes cluster. 

In this section we will focus on 3 steps we need to create.
1. Virtual Cloud Network + Subnet for the virtual machine 
2. Add HTTPS/443 rule to the security list, in order to connect to Rancher. 
3. Virtual machine with Oracle Developer image, in order to create a Docker.  


Step 1: 
## Create a Virtual Cloud Network + Subnet ## 
After you are connected to your cloud account, 
you will see the following dashboard screen.

Click on Virtual Cloud Networks.

Click on Create VCN button.

1. Enter the name: "oke-rancher-lab"
2. Choose your compartment name.
3. CIDR BLOCK - you can choose every private subnet you with. 
example: "10.0.0.0/16"
* Make sure it's not overlapping with other subnets you have 
4. Click on Create VCN button on the buttom.

Now click on the Create Subnet button.
1. Enter the name: "dev-subnet"
2. Leave the Regional option selected
3. from the CIDR BLOCK choose a sub-network from the choosen subnet previously. 
example: "10.0.0.0/24" 
4. Subnet access - must remain public (don't worry, we are just playing around). 
5. Scroll buttom and click on Create Subnet button.

Congratulations! you now have created a Virtual Network + Subnet.
Let's continue to the second step.

Step 2: 

## Add rules to security list ## 
 
 
Step 3: 

## Create a virtual machine and install Rancher ##

Open the side menu, and go to Compute.

Click on the Create Instance button.

<image> 
  
1. Enter the name: "dev-oke-rancher"
2. Choose your compartment name.
3. Click on Change image, then Oracle images, look for Oracle 
"Oracle Cloud Developer Image"	
Scroll down and check the checkbox:
I have reviewed and accept the Oracle Standard Terms and Restrictions.
Click on Select Image. 
4.* Note you are going to create a shape with 1 OCPU (Intel) + 15Gb RAM.
5. Choose your Virtual Cloud Network you created before.
6. Choose your subnet you created before. 
7. Make sure that ASSIGN A PUBLIC IP ADDRESS is checked.

8. Scroll down to Add SSH Keys. 

Here it's a bit tricky, but we will do it together.
