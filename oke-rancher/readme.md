Our goals will be to get familiar with 
1. Cloud native solutions on Oracle cloud (OKE),
2. Managing the Kubernetes cluster using Rancher
3. Simplifying Deployments and monitoring using Rancher. 

## Before you begin, here are some prerequisite: ##


1. before you being make sure you have Oracle OCI account.
Sign in page: https://www.oracle.com/cloud/sign-in.html
If you don't have a cloud account,

you can create a free accout trial here:

**If you have signed for a zoominar,
you can enjoy a $500 promotion and no credit card required** 

```diff 
- These steps apply only if you are using your current OCI Account, and you are not under root compartment
- please make sure you have permissions for:

- 1a. Creating Virtual Cloud Network and Subnets.
- 1b. Creating Compute Instance + Shapes + Images permission.
- 1c. Creating OKE Cluster with all the permissions.
- 1d. Make sure your OKE has permissions to create Networks and Storage.

## Lab steps: ## 

First thing we will do is prepare a virtual machine with Oracle Developer image,
and prepare our cloud, so we can connect to the machine and launch a Rancher Docker.

1. [Create a virtual machine with Rancher installed on Docker](vm.md) 

After we have a Rancher installed, 
we will create an OKE cluster on cloud. 

2. [Create an OKE cluster using Rancher](cluster.md)

We have a cluster up and running with nodes, 
now it's time to install apps on the cluster. 

3. [Install Wordpress app from Rancher catalog and manage it](wp.md)

Our apps are up and running, let's monitor them. 

4. [Monitoring the cluster and the app](mon.md)
