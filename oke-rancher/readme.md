Our goal is to get familiar with the following: 
1. Oracle IaaS - OCI (Oracle Cloud Infrastructure)
2. Oracle Cloud Native Solutions - OKE (Oracle Kubernetes Engine) 
3. Managing the Kubernetes Engine Cluster using Rancher
4. Simplifying Deployments and monitoring them using Rancher

## Before you begin, here are some prerequisite: ##


1. First, make sure you have an Oracle OCI account.
Sign in page: https://www.oracle.com/cloud/sign-in.html

**If you don't have a cloud account yet,**
**you can create a free account trial here:** 
**https://bit.ly/ocicredits**

**If you have signed for a zoominar,
you can enjoy a $500 promotion and no credit card required** 

```diff 
- **Existing Accounts only!** 
- These steps apply only if you are using your current OCI Account, and you are not under root compartment
- please make sure you have permissions for:

- 1a. Creating Virtual Cloud Network and Subnets.
- 1b. Creating Compute Instance + Shapes + Images permission.
- 1c. Creating OKE Cluster with all the permissions.
- 1d. Make sure your OKE has permissions to create Networks and Storage.

## Lab Agenda: ## 

First, we shall create a virtual machine with Oracle Developer image,
connect it to Oracle cloud, and launch a Rancher Docker:

1. [Create a virtual machine with Rancher installed on Docker](vm.md) 

Once Rancher is installed, 
we shall create an OKE cluster on Oracle cloud:

2. [Create an OKE cluster using Rancher](cluster.md)

We have a cluster up and running with nodes, 
now it is time to install apps on the cluster:

3. [Install Wordpress app from Rancher catalog and manage it](wp.md)

Our apps are up and running, 
let's monitor the Kubernetes cluster, and see the workloads:

4. [Monitoring the cluster and the app](mon.md)
